I want to showcase an old personal project. I wrote a mobile app called sessions that was successfully deployed to the app store.
This was a social media app that was centered around fitness and the gym. Here is a quick blurb from my previous website about this:

Sessions is a gym-focused social media app that allows users to log their workouts, connect with friends, and share their fitness journey.
At Sessions it’s not about lifting more weight than the person next to you, it is about lifting each other up.

Feel free to workshop this if you need to. I want you to:
Create a new project card on the belotech home site
when the project is clicked, open up a new page with a new route ("/sessions" would do)
Use the explanation of sessions that I provided above as well as the 3 images I have added to the src/assets folder
these images are screenshots of the app
Emphasize that this project is now retired/done and I have open sourced it.
display the following github repos with descriptions of their tech stack:
https://github.com/BeloTechnologies/session-user
https://github.com/BeloTechnologies/session-mobile
